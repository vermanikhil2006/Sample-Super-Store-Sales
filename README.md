# Sample-Super-Store-Sales
I developed a comprehensive project in PowerBI, creating multiple dashboards to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

## Dataset used

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Add Charts best suited for the need.
